//                              Forsim Tool
//=============================================================================
/**
The ForsimTool enables forward dynamic simulations of joint mechanics to be 
performed. Practically, this allows simulations of cadaver experiments, 
passive clinical examinations, and simulations where the muscle forces or 
excitations are known inputs. 

Fundamentally, this tool is similar to the ForwardTool in the opensim-core,
but the interface is designed to facilitate forward simulations involving 
joint mechanics and specifically articular contact. Additionally, the 
forsim tool uses an implicit integrator (SimTK::CPODES::BDF), which provides 
superior performance for simulations that involve contact compared to the 
explicit integrators used by the existing OpenSim ForwardTool. 

The following optional input input files can be used to define time varying 
simulation parameters:

actuator_input_file: Define muscle and actuator controls (excitations), 
activations, or forces vs time.

external_loads_file: Define the external loads and the model segments
that they are acting on. 

prescribed_coordinate_file: Define the prescribed coordinates in the 
model and their values vs time.  

## Muscle Modeling 
The controls (excitation), activation, or force in the muscles can be 
explictly defined as constants, or time varying functions. Furthermore,
the underlying models of activation and muscle-tendon dynamics can be
used in full complexity or simplified to improve simulation performance. 
A constant control can be input to all muscles using the 
constant_muscle_control property. If use_activation_dynamics is set to
false, the constant_muscle_control also becomes a constant activation (e = a). 
If use_tendon_compliance is false, then the tendons are set to be rigid.
If use_muscle_physiology is false, then activation dynamics, pennation angle 
and all force-length-velocity 
properties are ignored, the tendon is rigid, and the force in the muscle
is computed F = constant_muscle_control * max_isometric_force. 
Time varying control, activation, or force can be set for individual 
muscles in the actuator_input_file. Any muscles listed in the actuator_input_file
are not affected by the aforementioned property settings. Remember that 
default activation (ie initial) and minimum activation are
not always the same in the OpenSim muscle models. If use_activation_dynamics
is true, the intial activation will not instateously decay to the minimum
activation.
